# 01-Challenge

Description

This project was based on the following User Story:

AS A marketing agency
```
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
AND Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

This project has been a great experience and I'm amazed by what I can do in just 1 week. I've learned a lot from this project and have more confidence in the projects that will follow.
